These are some sample files from the website pondlehocky. These are the controller files for the pages that are created on the front-end and controlled on the backend. This folder also contains widgets that I made for this site in order to extend it's functionality. This code is old, the current code base is structured differently so that's why I'm including this in my code samples. I also wan't to endanger the client in anyway so that's why depreciated code is being shared.

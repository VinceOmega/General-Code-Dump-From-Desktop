This folder contains code used to develop a dynamic map application that takes the zip code of the user and directs them to the 5 closest stores that carry the product the client is selling. I have removed most of the listings from this demo, only the PA stores are in this version as I didn't want to give away their whole distrubtion chain.

The application uses google maps v3 API.

You will also need an google maps API KEY to use this application.

You can use mine for this demo if need be:
